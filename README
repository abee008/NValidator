NValidator is a lightweight extensible validation library for .NET that support fluent syntax.
The implementation and fluent syntax are inspired from the well-known library Fluent Validation.
However, I implemented it using Chain of Reponsibility pattern and made it fully support Dependency Injection for validator classes.
